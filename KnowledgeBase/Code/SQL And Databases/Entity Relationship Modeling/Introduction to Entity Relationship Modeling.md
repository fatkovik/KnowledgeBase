Entity Relationship Modeling (ER modeling) is a technique used in database design to represent the logical structure of a database visually. It helps to identify the entities (tables), attributes (columns), and a relationship between them, making it easier to understand and communicate the database design.

ER diagrams consist of the following components
- **Entities**: Represented by rectangles, entities are the tables or objects in the database.
- **Attributes**: Listed inside the entity rectangle, attributes are the columns or fields that describe the entity.
- **Relationships**: Represented by lines connecting entities, relationships depict the associations between entities.
