[[Introduction to Entity Relationship Modeling]]

Modality refers to whether the existence of an entity instance depends on its relationship with another entity. There are two main types of modality:

- Partial modality: The existence of an instance does not depend on its relationship with another entity. For example, a customer can exist without having any orders.
- Total modality: The existence of an instance depends on its relationship with another entity. For example, an order item cannot exist without an order.

In ER diagrams, modality is represented using specific notation, such as a single bar for partial modality and a double bar for total modality.
