[[DataBases]]
Relationships are the cornerstone of relational databases, allowing you to connect and combine data from different tables. There are three main types of relationships:

- One-to-One: One record in Table A is related to one and only one record in Table B, and vice versa.
- One-to-Many: One record in Table A can be related to multiple records in Table B, but one record in Table B can be related to only one record in Table A.
- Many-to-Many: Multiple records in Table A can be related to multiple records in Table B, and vice versa.
