[[Introduction to Keys]]
A surrogate key is an artificial key (often a sequential number or a GUID) that is used as the primary key in a table. It has no inherent meaning or relationship to the data itself. A natural key, on the other hand, is a key derived from the data itself, such as an employee ID or a product code.

## Should I use Surrogate Keys or Natural Keys?

The choice between surrogate keys and natural keys depends on several factors, including the nature of the data, the likelihood of data changes, and the potential for duplication or conflicts.

Surrogate keys are often preferred because they are:

- Immutable: They do not change over time, even if the data changes.
- Guaranteed unique: They are generated by the database system, ensuring uniqueness.
- Opaque: They do not reveal any information about the data itself, which can be beneficial for security and privacy.

Natural keys, on the other hand, can be advantageous when:

- The data has inherent uniqueness, such as product codes or employee IDs.
- The data is unlikely to change over time, reducing the risk of conflicts or duplication.
- There is a need for human-readable and meaningful identifiers.
