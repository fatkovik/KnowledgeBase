Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy, minimize data anomalies (insertion, update and deletion anomalies), and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down a database into smaller tables and defining relationship between them based on specific rules or normal forms.

The primary goals of database normalization are:

1. Elimination redundant data
2. Ensuring Data integrity
3. Facilitating data manipulation and maintenance.

There are several normal forms in database normalization, each building upon the previous one. The most commonly used normal forms are:

1. First Normal Form (1NF)
2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
3. Third Normal Form (3NM)

By following the principles of database normalization, you can create well-structured and efficient databases that minimize redundancy, maintain data integrity, and facilitate data manipulation and maintenance.
