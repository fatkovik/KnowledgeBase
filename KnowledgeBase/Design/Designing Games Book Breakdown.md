1. **Emotion and Change The bedrock principle behind all emotional triggers is change.** 

To cause emotion, an event must signal a meaningful change in the world. But not just any change will create emotion. To provoke emotion, an event must change some HUMAN VALUE. 

For example, an asteroid crashing into a distant planet is an astronomical curiosity. An asteroid crashing into Earth is the most wrenching event that could occur. The difference is in the implications to human beings. In one case, nothing human-relevant happened. The other represents a massive shift from life to death. [life/death] is an example of a human value. A HUMAN VALUE is anything that is important to people that can shift through multiple states. Human values can be in positive, neutral, or negative states. 

Only changes that shift human values between these states are emotionally relevant. Some examples of human values are [life/death], [victory/defeat], [friend/stranger/enemy], [wealth/poverty], [low status/high status], [together/alone], [love/ambivalence/hatred], [freedom/slavery], [danger/ safety], [knowledge/ignorance], [skilled/unskilled], [healthy/sick], and [follower/leader]. Events in games can shift all these values and more.

2. **Emotion Through Challenge** 

Tests of skill and strength create emotions in many ways. As we struggle at them, we enter a pleasurable state of focus. When we pass them, we feel energized, capable, and dominant. Even failure instills a sense of wanting to try again and do better, as long as the player senses the possibility of success. Challenge is so closely associated with games that it’s often assumed to be an essential aspect of the medium. It’s part of many common definitions of games. But though it is a powerful and flexible method, challenge is still only one more emotional trigger, and not a necessary part of every game design. The Sims, Minecraft, Snakes and Ladders, Dear Esther, and roulette all create powerful emotions without players struggling toward a predefined objective. That being said, challenge is still an important part of most game designs, so a large part of this book is devoted to understanding it.

3. **Emotion Through Music** 

Music is a powerful and flexible tool for generating emotion. Since it’s so easy to mix into an experience, it’s used liberally across many media. Films play exciting music during action scenes, nightclubs play sexy music late at night, and daytime talk shows play sad or triumphant songs to emphasize whatever narrative they’re trying to create. Games do the same thing with action, ambient, or scary music.

4. **Emotion Through Environment** 

Lightly wooded grassland feels different from steamy, claustrophobic jungle, which feels different from arctic tundra. And these feelings shift with time and season—winter feels different from summer, night different from day, rain different from shine. There’s evidence that these responses are partly innate. Psychology researchers have found that American children shown photographs of various environments say they would prefer to live in savannas, even though they’ve never been to one. These emotions may reflect an evolutionary imperative to seek out places where a tribe can thrive: fertile, not too hot or cold, not too open or overgrown. The perfect environment for prehistoric humans is open grassland with patches of woods and running water. So when we find a place like this, we feel satisfied and at ease. This emotional reaction draws us into these places where we can reproduce best.

5. **The Fiction Layer** 

There are some games that are just mechanics and nothing more. Poker, soccer, checkers, and video games such as Geometry Wars or Bejeweled are examples of this. In checkers, the pieces are just that: pieces. They move based on arbitrary rules that don’t relate to anything outside themselves. A soccer ball is just a ball, and an enemy in Geometry Wars is just a piece of data in computer memory, represented by an abstract shape on a screen. These kinds of games can work very well. Pure game mechanics with abstract representations can provoke tension, doubt, puzzlement, and triumph. They can shift values between victory and defeat, poverty and wealth, ignorance and knowledge. But most real games don’t limit themselves to the abstract. They use graphics and sounds to help players make believe that the mechanics are more than an artificial system of rules. Mechanics gain another layer of emotional meaning when they are wrapped in FICTION.

At their core, all games are no more than mechanics, just as Dr. Evil’s fembots are no more than metal and rubber. Mario isn’t a cartoon Italian plumber—he’s a collision cylinder that slides around and bumps into things. That teenager falling in love in The Sims really didn’t—the game software just flipped a few bits in a data structure somewhere.

6. **Constructing Experiences**

An experience is the combined expression of every effect the game has upon the player’s psychology, stretching from the beginning of play to the end. It transforms itself through setup and payoff, expectation and result. A thought leads to an emotion, which sparks an idea, which causes a reaction, which brings feedback, leading to another thought. And just as a well-made meal is more than the sum of its ingredients, an experience is more than the sum of its psychological components. 

Game experiences are always mixed. A soccer player up 2-1 near the end of a game feels hopeful for a win, but worried about a penalty. A kid playing Super Mario Galaxy feels happy because of the upbeat music, while gritting his teeth through a hard jumping challenge.

Pure Emotion To maximize a single feeling, we can combine several different emotional triggers that drive the exact same emotion. Each trigger is like another booster rocket that pushes the experience further toward one pure emotional peak. For example, traditional action arcade games combine fast-paced music, risky situations, violent fiction, and testosterone-driven social competition to make the game as exciting as possible. Any one of these triggers could work on its own to create excitement. Together they boost the experience to levels none of them could achieve separately.

**Juxtaposition**

Juxtaposition is the combination of different, seemingly incompatible feelings. Ramming together feelings that don’t ordinarily mix can produce strange and sometimes valuable results. 

7. Emotional Variation 

Any single emotion gets tiring if sustained too long. To retain power and freshness, an experience must transform over time. One classic way of doing this is pacing variation. This method has been used and studied for years by traditional storytellers, to the point where they’ve developed a specific pacing formula that they reuse over and over. The classic pacing curve starts with the hook, settles into a rising action, builds up, and then finally peaks at its climax before resolving with a denouement. Graphed out, it looks like this:

This curve can be found in countless media—films, books, comedy routines, infomercials, operas, and songs—because it is incredibly effective. It hooks people, holds attention, and leaves the audience satisfied without ever exhausting them. Games can exhibit this pacing curve as well. And not just by writing it in a predefined story—we can create game mechanics which generate it on the fly.

**Flow** 

Flow is a popular concept in psychology that is particularly applicable to game design. It was originally described by the Hungarian psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. He described it this way: FLOW is a state of concentration so focused that it amounts to total absorption in an activity.
