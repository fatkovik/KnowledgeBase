[[Design Core]]
# **Chapter 1**

1. The Magic Words: “I am a game designer.” Confidence always come after work not before. “Pretending” to be a designer is part of becoming one.


- **Anthropology** – Study your players’ behaviors to design games that truly connect with them.
    
- **Architecture** – Learn how people interact with spaces to design immersive worlds.
    
- **Brainstorming** – You’ll need to come up with hundreds of creative ideas.
    
- **Business** – Knowing the business side helps you turn your game dreams into reality.
    
- **Cinematography** – Master camera and film techniques to tell powerful stories in games.
    
- **Communication** – Work closely with others, solve misunderstandings, and get honest feedback.
    
- **Creative Writing** – You’ll craft entire fictional worlds, characters, and storylines.
    
- **Economics** – Many games have complex economies; understanding them helps with balance.
    
- **Engineering** – Knowing how technology works helps you design new kinds of gameplay.
    
- **History** – Even fantasy games draw inspiration from real-world history.
    
- **Management** – Teams need structure. Good designers often manage quietly from within.
    
- **Mathematics** – From game logic to graphics, math is everywhere in game design.
    
- **Music** – Music creates emotional depth and immersion in your games.
	
- **Animation** – Modern games rely on lifelike characters. Knowing how animation brings them to life unlocks unique and creative game design opportunities.
	
-  **Psychology** – Understand how the mind works to create enjoyable, engaging games.
    
- **Public Speaking** – Present ideas clearly and confidently to inform, persuade, or inspire.
    
- **Sound Design** – Sound makes the game world feel real; hearing truly is believing.
    
- **Technical Writing** – Write clear, detailed documents to communicate your design ideas.
    
- **Visual Arts** – Use graphic design to shape the mood and style of your game.

3. The most important skill is not the creativity or critical thinking or even logic. The most important skill is to listen to everyone and everything as deep as you can.
4. There are 5 kinds of listening.
	1. To your team.
	2. To your audience.
	3. To your game.
	4. To your client.
	5. To yourself.

  5.True game design talent isn’t just about natural skill. It is about a work and loving to work. You must learn, try, do and work as much as you can to be a game designer. If making games makes you feel alive so its your path. And don't forget YOU ARE A GAME DESIGNER( I Am A Surgeon!!!)



# **Chapter 2**

1.Creating the experiences is all a game designer really cares about. But the thing is that everything is an experience and you should choose wisely what experience you want your game to perform. It is hard to talk about experience because every experience is too familiar.

2.The game enables the experience, but it is not the experience. “If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? ”. Game designers only care about what seems to exist. In a sense, this is the dream of “artificial reality ” — to be able to create experiences that are in no way limited by the constraints of the medium that delivers the experiences.

3.How can you create something that will generate a certain experience when a person interacts with it? The author of a book or screenplay is designing a linear experience. Game designers don’t have it so easy. We give the player a great deal of control over the pacing and sequence of events in the experience.

*Three Practical Approaches to Chasing Rainbows*
Psychology, Anthropology, and Design. Psychologists want to understand the mechanisms that make people tick, anthropologists want to understand people on a human level, and designers just want to make people happy. We will be using approaches borrowed from all three of these fields.

Psychology
	Psychologists used to study only what they can measure, but not what actually people feel. Game designers can mix these experiments with looking inward at their own experiences to create games that feel real and meaningful to players.

Anthropology
	Of particular interest to game designers is the approach of cultural anthropology, which is the study of living peoples ’ ways of life, mostly through fieldwork. By taking a cultural anthropologist’s approach to our players, interviewing them, learning everything we can about them, and putting ourselves in their place.

Design
	The incredible variety of design “rules of thumb ” that comes from these different disciplines do an excellent job of illustrating useful principles about human experience. Anyone who creates something that people are meant to experience and enjoy has something to teach us. We must be both open-minded and practical — good ideas can come from anywhere, but they are only good for us if they help us create better experiences.

*Introspection*
This is the seemingly simple act of examining your own thoughts and feelings — that is, your own experiences.

Peril #1: Introspection Can Lead to False Conclusions About Reality
	Just because something feels true, it doesn’t mean it is true. Good scientists use introspection all the time — but they don’t draw scientific conclusions from it. We (game designers) primarily care about what “ feels like it is true. ”. Aristotle's ideas are discredited today because he relied too much on what felt true, but we all know him as genius because his works are still useful today.  To understand experience and what things feel like, introspection is an incredibly powerful, and trustworthy tool.

Peril #2: What Is True of My Experiences May Not be True for Others
	**“I only design for people like me ” has these problems:**

	  You might love a game idea that most people don’t share, so it may not find enough players to make it worth the cost.
    
	  You won’t work by yourself, and teammates with different opinions can make decisions hard.
    
	  Certain game styles and target groups may be off-limits to you, so you’ll have to choose your audience and genre carefully.
  

	**“Personal opinions can’t be trusted ” has these problems:**
	
	   You can’t wait for playtests—designers must make instinctive calls on what works and what 
   doesn’t.
	   
	   If you ignore your own instincts, you risk discarding an “ugly duckling” that could’ve become a swan.
	   
	   Playtesting can only happen occasionally. Important game design decisions must be made on a daily basis.  


*Dissect Your Feelings*
When you play a game, you must be able to analyze how it made you feel, what it made you think of, and what it made you do as concrete as you are able to. Analyze your experiences.

*Defeating Heisenberg*
Try to observe yourself enjoying a movie or a game, and the enjoyment can quickly fade away. This makes introspection sound hopeless. While it is a challenging problem, there are ways around it that are quite effective, though some take practice.(near will be added the processes for defeating heisenberg)
